This is the implemnetation of my own quic protocol from scratch.
I noticed with my Proxy that all the traffic goes to a single tcp connection with multiplexing (really good),
the only hting is that it gets into the head-of-line blocking, if any packet is loss or is really slow.

If someone reads this. Im curerntly learning a lot to implement this protocol, but im pretty busy working
and practicing DSA, so this part of the project could take some time :)
