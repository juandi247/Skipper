1. Import net package

2. Dial the server: net.Dial() function permits to stablish a connection to the server,
we would need to specifcy the network typoe and server ip adfdres and portnumber
net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:8080")


3. Read and write data: we can use the "conn" object to send and receive data (this would probably
be used later on, for the tranmision of data to the reverse proxy using a parsed json of the request!!)

4. Close the connection using conn.close() probably with a defer (or a listentning goroutine on the proxy to check for timouts, or inatcitivyt)
